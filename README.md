# Saturn

Project Saturn is my take on developing a web app for learning purposes. The objective is:

- to build an app that I would put in production

- explore ideas and methods for web app development

- document learnings and share knowledge with others

## What I will build

I will build a platform where users can trade used video games. Some basic features include:

- Users can login/logout
- Users can manage an inventory of games
- Users can search for games
- Users can message other users
- Users can make games available/unavailable for exchange
- Users receive notifications when someone request an exchange

## Principles

- [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
